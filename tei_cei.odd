    <p>TEI-P5-based schema aims at helping with the encoding of single sheet legal documents as
     studied in the historial science of diplomatics. It is based upon the experience of the <ref
      target="http://www.cei.lmu.de">Charters Encoding Initiative.</ref>.</p>
    <p>For a start it includes the following modules of the TEI-P5 definition: <list>
      <item>header, linking, core, tei, textstructure: core modules</item>
      <item>namesdates: <list>
        <item>The specialized elements persName and placeName from namesdates are to be preferred
         over name in all instances. For usage, see <ref
          target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ND.html">13. Names, Dates,
          People, and Places</ref> fom the TEI P5 documentation. When selecting which text to
         encapsulate in persName, "person, possibly including one or more of the person's forenames,
         surnames, honorifics, added names, etc.," it is recommended to err on the side of
         inclusivity rather than exclusivity, as there is a significant variation in the
         representation of persons across documents and abstracts.</item>
        <item>As much as possible, tracking of individual persons should be done through references
         to a personography file, where titles and parts of names can be specified. Lists of names
         with parallel elements are not normalized in the text, but in the persography; so, in the
         list "Erzbisch√∂fe Johannes von Edessa (Eddessiensis) und Pontius von Seleucia
         (Seleuciensis)", Pontius von Seleucia (Seleuciensis) would be marked as a persName and the
         title of Archbishop of Seleucia in Isauria would be indicated as a roleName in the
         personography. If the dates of incumbancy are known, they could be indicated through
         attributes of the <ref
          target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-att.datable.html2"
          >att.datable class</ref>.</item>
        <item>Geographic names, when they appear outside of personal names and titles, should be
         indicated by placeName and a reference to a placeography file or the <ref
          target="http://www.geonames.org/">geonames database</ref>; where they appear inside
         personal names and titles, this markup would occur in the personography file. Geographic
         names are marked up even when, as in the case of the Archbishopric of Seleucia in Isauria,
         the geographic element of the roleName is titular. In this case, the type attribute may be
         used to express this, as in <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <roleName type="catholic">
           Archbishop
           <nameLink>of</nameLink>
           <placeName type="see,titular" ref="http://sws.geonames.org/300808/about.rdf,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1727060">Seleucia in Isauria</placeName>
          </roleName>
         </egXML>.</item>
        <item>A ref atribute with a link to a local typology or to <ref
          target="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</ref> is included to disambiguate the location
         (where possible); in the absence of a comprehensive linkable ontology of historic sees and
         other geographic divisions, <ref target="https://www.wikidata.org">Wikidata</ref> may be
         preferable in some cases; in the example, the Geonames reference is to Silifke, modern
         Seleucia, and the Wikidata reference is to entry for the titular see.</item>
       </list>
      </item>
      <item>transcr: </item>
      <item>figures: </item>
      <item>msdescription: <list>
        <item>Documents should, as much as possible, be treated as examples of manuscripts,
         following the advice in <ref
          target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html">10. Manuscript
          Description</ref>, except in the case of new elements in this specification, such as
         diploDesc and authDesc and modified elements, such as sealDesc, seal, monogram, and
         chirograph.</item>
        <item>In most cases, where single-folio documents are being transcribed, they can be
         foliated using the pb element and an xml:id set to "f1r" before the beginning of the text
         on the recto and "f1v" before the text on the verso. In the case of documents of more than
         one sheet, the foliation element should be used to describe the relationships of
         items.</item>
        <item>The intent of these guidelines is to describe individual documents in the sense of
         discrete charters. Where these charters are collected together in a cartulary or the like,
         each charter should be its own tei document, and the book/collection should be represented
         as a separate tei document which refers to the individual charters as a series of msItem
         elements inside the msContents element, with a link to each individual element. The
         collection container may (and should, preferably), contain msItem descriptions of
         non-diplomatic material that is contained alongside the diplomatic material.</item>
        <item>Where a document previously existed separately, but is now bound in with other
         material, the previously-separate elements should be marked up using msPart. Where a
         previously-unitary document now exists in multiple parts, each individual fragment should
         be marked up using msFrag.</item>
        <item>Where a single document, such as a court case, appears on multiple, interrupted folios
         in the same manuscript, the individual cases, as above, should be represented by msPart
         elements and the collection of discontinuous folios should be organized using the locus and
         locusGrp elements.</item>
       </list></item>
      <item>gaiji: gaiji provides the g element, which is to encode glyphs, and may be used to
       represent various special textual symbols in texts that are considered to be
       important/distinct. This supercedes the (former) use of cei:c, and is to be preferred over
       the TEI c element, except where specific linguistic information is being encoded, as opposed
       to special characters such as medieval textual abbreviations, like p(ro), p(er), o(rum), etc.
       Please see the guidance in <ref
        target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/WD.html">5. Characters, Glyphs,
        and Writing Modes</ref>.</item>
      <item>certainty: Often, it will be the case that there might be multiple possible
       interpretations for the correct identification of a person or a place in the text. In these
       cases, the certainty element, as documented in <ref
        target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CE.html#CECECE">21.1.2.
        Structured Indications of Uncertainty</ref> should be used, to represent the uncertainty of
       the editor in a way that can be interpreted by a proccesor.</item>
